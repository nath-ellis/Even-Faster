# Even Faster
Even Faster is the sequel to [God Speed](https://github.com/noxJ/God-Speed) and was created because God Speed needed improvements but I wanted to turn it into a web game.

## The game
It is very similar to [God Speed](https://github.com/noxJ/God-Speed) but there are 4 lanes instead of 2, you can move up and down the road and toggle a police siren. \
There is also more music and a greater difficulty as well as being able to be played in the browser.

## Controls
Up Arrow / W to go up \
Down Arrow / S to go down \
Left Arrow / A to go left \
Right Arrow / D to go right \
F1 to toggle Siren \
F2 to toggle music
